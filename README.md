# Tiny Singing Voice Database
this is a fork of the original "tiny-singing-voice-database" that cleans up some of the .wav files and also converts and relabels the transcriptions.
the original has been laid inactive for 7 years so I guess whatever person who recorded it gave up. if they come back and decide they don't like a database of their voice out there, I'll take this down.
it also doesn't have a license but I'm going to assume no commercial use. this includes my .lab files. you can just ask though.

The database is labeled using arpabet, and includes the phonemes dx (tapped "r" in Spanish and present the English word "butter"), AP (asperated pause.) and el (the "le" in bottle). if you need to modify or change any labels in here, be my guest.
